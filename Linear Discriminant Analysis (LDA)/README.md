# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Fundamentals

Welcome to the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Fundamentals repository! Here, we delve into the core concepts of LDA and explore its powerful applications in machine learning and pattern recognition. Whether you're a data scientist or a researcher, this repository serves as an excellent resource to deepen your understanding of LDA.

## What is Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)?
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction and classification technique widely used in supervised learning. It aims to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes in a dataset. LDA is particularly valuable for feature selection, noise reduction, and improving classification accuracy.
