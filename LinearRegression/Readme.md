Welcome to the Linear Regression Folder! ðŸš€ Here, we explore the fundamentals of linear regression and its applications in predictive modeling. Whether you're new to machine learning or seeking a refresher, this repository is a great place to start.

# What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It is widely used for predicting numeric values based on input data and understanding the underlying patterns in data.
