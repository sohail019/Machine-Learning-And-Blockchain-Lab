Welcome to the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) Implementation project! This repository explores the fundamentals of CART, a versatile machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repository is an excellent resource to understand and implement CART.

## What is CART?
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is a decision tree algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It recursively splits the dataset into subsets based on the most significant feature, resulting in a tree-like structure that can make predictions or classify data points.
