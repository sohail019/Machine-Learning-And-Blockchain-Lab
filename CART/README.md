# Classification and Regression Trees (CART) Implementation

Welcome to the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) Implementation project! This repository explores the fundamentals of CART, a versatile machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repository is an excellent resource to understand and implement CART.

## What is CART?
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is a decision tree algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It recursively splits the dataset into subsets based on the most significant feature, resulting in a tree-like structure that can make predictions or classify data points.


## Features
- Implementation of CART for both classification and regression.
- Gini impurity and weighted Gini impurity as splitting criteria for classification.
- Mean squared error as the splitting criterion for regression.
- Tree pruning to avoid overfitting.
- Real-world examples and use cases.

## Contents
- Introduction to CART: Understand the basic concepts and principles of CART.
- CART for Classification: Implement CART for classification tasks.
- CART for Regression: Apply CART for regression problems.
- Gini Impurity and Weighted Gini: Learn about Gini impurity and weighted Gini for classification.
- Mean Squared Error: Explore mean squared error for regression.
- Tree Pruning: Discover techniques for tree pruning to prevent overfitting.
- Real-World Examples: Apply CART to real-world datasets and problem statements.
- Best Practices: Find tips and best practices for effective CART modeling.

## Getting Started
Before using CART, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- matplotlib (for visualization, optional)



## Experiment with Diverse Datasets
To gain a deeper understanding of CART, we encourage you to experiment with different datasets. Apply CART to various data scenarios to observe how it constructs decision trees and makes predictions.

By working with diverse datasets, you'll uncover the versatility of CART in addressing real-world classification and regression challenges.
